# Pokedex

## About 
This project began as 'a Pokédex made in Go' where I managed data using the PokeAPI. For the frontend implementation, I used Wails, which allows the use of web technologies and greatly simplified the process of creating a user interface. Finally, here is a simple and perhaps not highly polished version of a project that I found very entertaining, educational, and filled with nostalgia.
